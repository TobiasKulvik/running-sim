# running-sim

Running-sim is a simple program that was made for a school project.

# Modules

Needed modules:

- Tkinter
- MatPlotLib
- Math
- Pandas

# Description

My group made functions with data from the heart rate of a participant while running and after stopping. The program uses three mathematical functions for the entire development of the heart rate. Comments are added to describe what the different parts do. I made this py project with Tkinter. Feel free to try and improve it if you want!
